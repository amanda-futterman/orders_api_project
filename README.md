# orders_api_project
Playing around with Swagger to create an API

# why
I realized that I had a gap in understanding of the connection between the Front-end and Back-end of software. I find that my learning type is doing things myself to get a true understanding of the material. 

# how
I followed the course titled 'API Development with Swagger and OpenAPI' and through this I was able to actually create a tangible connection between the Front-end and Back-end of software. SwaggerAPI tools like, Swagger Editor, Swagger Codegen, and Swagger UI created by SmartBear helped me fill in these gaps. 

# what
The project itself was the creation of yaml code which acts as the API for an orders scenario. With the help of this course I learned that this situation can be split into 4 categories. 
  1. reading the order data
  2. adding a new order
  3. deleting an order
  4. updating an order
By using HTTP verbs like, GET, PUT, POST and DELETE these categories were given purpose. 

# testing
1. download the project file, preferably open it with the PyCharm IDE because it is connected to Swagger tooling. 
2. open the openapi.yaml file
3. click chrome button which will open the Orders API within the swagger website to view API in a more human-readable and visually appealing way
4. OR go into the terminal, run the commands 'npm install' and 'npm run' a localhost should open up.

# future
There is much further to go into this project by writing more code to actually utilize the API beyond basic tooling creation, however, my original goal was to better understand how API's work and I believe that this was achieved. I can create a front-end interface for interacting with the API. I can also create more end points like merging 2 orders together.
